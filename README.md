Milestone 1: Data Collection, Exploration, and Preprocessing
1.	Data Collection: Use the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. Ensure the dataset contains transaction features and fraud labels. 
Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection
2.	Data Exploration (EDA): Understand the structure of the dataset. Analyze class imbalance (percentage of fraud vs. non-fraud transactions). Visualize feature distributions, correlations, and anomalies using tools like heatmaps and pair plots.
3.	Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values (if any) and outliers. Normalize numerical features (e.g., transaction amount) using techniques like Min-Max Scaling or Standardization. Address class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) or under sampling. 
4.	Deliverables: EDA Report: Summary of dataset characteristics, key patterns, and challenges. Preprocessed Dataset: A cleaned and balanced dataset ready for model building.
   
Milestone 2: Feature Engineering and Selection

1.	Feature Engineering: Create new features, such as: Time since the last transaction. Aggregates (e.g., average transaction amount per user). Derive interaction features to capture relationships between variables. 
2.	Feature Selection: Use correlation analysis and statistical tests (e.g., Chi-Square) to identify key features. Employ model-based techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or feature importance from tree-based models. 
3.	Deliverables: Feature Engineering Summary: Documentation of created features and their relevance. Optimized Feature Set: Dataset with the most important features selected.
   
Milestone 3: Model Development and Evaluation

1.	Model Selection: Test classification algorithms such as: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), Neural Networks. Compare models using baseline performance metrics. 
2.	Model Training: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Use cross-validation to evaluate generalization. 
3.	Model Evaluation: Use metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix. Analyze True Positives, False Positives, and False Negatives. 
4.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization. 
5.	Deliverables: Model Evaluation Report: Summary of model performance and selected model. Python Code: Code used for model training and evaluation. Best-Performing Model: Ready for deployment.
   
Milestone 4: Deployment and Monitoring

1.	Model Deployment: Deploy the model as an API using Flask or FastAPI. Build a web interface or dashboard for real-time fraud detection. 
2.	Monitoring: Set up tools to monitor model performance on live data. Detect model drift or changes in fraud patterns. 
3.	Retraining Strategy: Plan periodic updates and retrain the model with new transaction data. 
4.	Deliverables: Deployed Model: A live API or dashboard for fraud detection. Monitoring Documentation: Instructions for tracking model performance and alerts. Retraining Plan: Strategy for handling evolving fraud patterns.
   
Milestone 5: Final Documentation and Presentation

1.	Final Report: Provide a comprehensive summary of the project, including: Dataset insights, Feature engineering, Model selection and deployment. Discuss challenges and solutions. 
2.	Final Presentation: Create a concise presentation highlighting: The impact of fraud detection on reducing risks. A live demo of the deployed system. 
Deliverables: Final Project Report: Summarizing the entire workflow and findings. Final Presentation: Slide deck and demo.
